# CSE 587 Data Intensive Computing


In this course I learned different data science tools and techniques needed to clean, extract, transform and load the data into Relational databases and also learned to make use of Big Data Technologies like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
The projects are in self-contained folders with all relevant information and datasets either provided or a link of them mentioned in the code to download them from.
